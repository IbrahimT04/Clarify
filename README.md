## Features
- Image enhancement (e.g., brightness, contrast adjustments)
- Basic image filtering techniques
- Edge detection
- Image format conversion

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (optional for easier build process)
- OpenCV (if required for additional functionality)

### Building from Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Clarify.git
   cd Clarify
   ```
2. Compile the project using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o clarify image_processing.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./clarify
   ```

## Usage

Run the program with an input image:
```bash
./clarify input.jpg output.jpg
```
Replace `input.jpg` with your source image and `output.jpg` with the desired output file.
